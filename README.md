# Socket.io-Chat-App


This was originally a project from the Full Stack Application diploma being offered at NSCC, Canada

The aim is to build a simple socket io chat app that:

1. Allows multiple connections to a chat server (multiple chat participants)
2. Client can connect and disconnect on button click
3. Displays connection status ('connected' when a client is connected and 'disconnected' when they disconnect)
4. Disables the connect or disconnect button when that state is active (When client is connected, disable connect button)
5. Toggles between a connected or disconnected UI (disabled text fields, disabled buttons, cleared messages etc.)
6. Displays the number of clients connected to a chat server
